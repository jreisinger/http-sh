http-sh
=======

* shell over HTTP - prove of concept
* you can send arbitrary commands to client part
* you can compile the client part with [pp](https://metacpan.org/module/pp) (of course you need the necessary libraries)
* the [Win32::Internet](https://metacpan.org/module/Win32::Internet) module uses `WININET.DLL` so you don't need to provide proxy credentials
